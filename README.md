# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.

## Overview of Project
 The purpose of this challange is to show how to create tables with SQL with using data from a company called Pewlett-Hackard which has many employees. The company wants to have a company wide retirement from people of the birthdate between 1952 through 1955. In this challange a database has been created to filter through those criteria to see who is on this list, their job title, and when they started. Also having a database and chart of people with job titles of current employees who can be in the mentors for the follwing new hires to replace the retirees.
## Results


## Summary
  The amount of roles that will need to be filled for the "silver tsunami" program that the Pewlett-Hackard will be quite massive. From the data of employees that were born between 1952 and 1955 there will be 90,398 employees that will need to retire. This will require a large amount of time to replace and train all of the new employees for these roles to be replaced. For the mentorship eligibility program there are 1,940 employees, compared to the 90,398 roles that will need to be replaced this is only 2.15% of the current employees and that is if all the employees in the mentorship program are eligible. This would be very demanding on the employees in the mentorship program and may work. But if the use of the retiree force is used to train the next generation employee then the demand on the current employees will be less severe.
